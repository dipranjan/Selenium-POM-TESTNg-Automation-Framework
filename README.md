## Welcome

The plan is to make an optimized but feature-rich automation framework to be used by myself and anyone interested.

As of now the features planned to be added are:

    * Maven based
    * POM
    * TestNg
    * Uses webdriver manager to automatically download drivers
    * Ashot
    * Video recording
    * Extent or Allure report
    * Support for headless browsers
    * Log4j logging capabilities

Will keep adding more as and when it comes to my mind.
